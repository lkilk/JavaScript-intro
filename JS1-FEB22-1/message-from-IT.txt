I am sorry to say a warning light has appeared on the server you are both using this week.  Can you please ask all your delegates to save their work before finishing this evening as I will be shutting down the server to investigate the problem.

 

As it is only a warning, it should not affect your use of the system for the rest of the week

 

Please inform your delegates their systems will not be available after 7pm until tomorrow morning.
